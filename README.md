## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://ismaelbz.github.io/devFinder/](https://ismaelbz.github.io/devFinder/)

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Javascript (fetch, async, destructuring)

### What I learned

I've learned many things doing this project. The main one is creating a theme-switching function in vanilla JS, and linked to that is how to make the theme color match the state of elements from the API response.

First, God, of course. Without Him, I wouldn't be here. Second, my mother and father. They are my strongest support, and there are no words to describe how incredible they are.

Finally, a shoutout to Frontend Mentor for providing this amazing free content for us, developers, to practice and showcase our skills.
